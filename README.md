# Phava

<h2>Phava</h2>

<p>Phava is a mashup library.</p>
<p>Uses PHP and MYSQLI as a database.</p>
<p>Phava Utilizes a custom PHP class based on the MySQLi-CRUD-PHP-OOP Library created by rorystandley.</p>
<p><a href ="https://github.com/rorystandley/MySQLi-CRUD-PHP-OOP.git" target="_blank"></p>

<p>This allows data queries to be built in PHP and MYSQLI and then converted to JSON arrays which can then be used by modern JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries.</p>

<p> Phava uses elements of MVC and OOP to allow integration with virtually any JavaScript Library or framework including AngularJS.</p>

<p>Phava is not a tradition MVC app. A more accurate description would be 
PHPModel JSModel PHPView HTMLView JSControl</p>

<p>The End result is then combined with BootCake another mashup which combines the UserCake PHP member Site Framework 

<p><a href ="http://usercake.com" target="_blank">USerCake Website</a></p>

with Bootstrap 3 and AngularJS.</p>

<p>Phava is very flexible, you don't have to use all these elements together by any means, you can use any of the things described above by themselevs or combined in any way you like. </p>
